# to-do-list
A virtual todo list
My first time using webpack, node.js, json files, and tailwind css. Tailwind styling didn't always work so I had to manipulate the input.css file for certain styles to activate.
Using Webpack default configuration and splitting up your development files and ES6 import and export features
Using Tailwind css
npm start
